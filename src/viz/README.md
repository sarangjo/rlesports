# Visualizations

| File name                      | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SimpleGraph](SimpleGraph.tsx) | Tournaments only, just list out teams and connect them by tournament                                  |
| [ForceGraph](ForceGraph.tsx)   | Using forces (`d3-force`) to keep teams together and link people across tournaments                   |
| [Sankey](Sankey.tsx)           | Uses a simple Sankey diagram (`d3-sankey`)                                                            |
| [Timeline](Timeline.tsx)       | Similar visual design to `SimpleGraph`, but includes information about when players leave/join teams. |
| [Table](Table.tsx)             | Simple HTML table of players and their teams                                                          |

## Timeline

Timeline is the best visualization, I'd argue.
