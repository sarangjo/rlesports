# Visualizations

| File name                             | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [ForceGraph](ForceGraph.tsx)          | Using forces (`d3-force`) to keep teams together and link people across tournaments                          |
| [PlayerTeams](PlayerTeams.tsx)        | **Not working** Aerial view of the teams at a given moment in time.                                          |
| [Sankey](Sankey.tsx)                  | Uses a simple Sankey diagram (`d3-sankey`)                                                                   |
| [Table](Table.tsx)                    | Simple HTML table of players and their teams                                                                 |
| [Timeline](Timeline.tsx)              | Similar visual design to `Tournaments/Simple`, but includes information about when players leave/join teams. |
| [Tournaments/Simple](Tournaments.tsx) | Tournaments only, just list out teams and connect them by tournament                                         |

## Timeline

Timeline is the best visualization, I'd argue.
